<h1>About D.Gray-Man Fans </h1>

<p>D.Gray-Man is a really good series. When I had stumble it when I was in middle school I fell in love with it. The world building, the chatacters, the storyline I love every single thing about it. It is a ongoing story still and I can't wait for every new volume!</p>

<p>The site also includes links to my favorite online D.Gray-Man resources. One day, I hope to include a section of reviews and comments.</p>
